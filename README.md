# HW-TrainSchedule

This application uses an external database on Firebase to store information on train schedules.

The user is able to add trains to the list above the input boxes, including the name, destination, and frequency of arrival.

Submitting the information will activate the timer, indicating the exact time the train departed.

The application will then calculate in real time the next time the train will arrive, updating every time the page loads.
